First thoughts
- It was hugely about the struggle with Bitsy's underlying representations
- So it might be possible to structure a discussion based on the key elements of a Bitsy (ends up being a kind-of-nice introduction to Bitsy itself?)
- The components then would be:
  - avatar (as person/object)
  - movement (could be folded into above? movement as the key interaction - the need to preserve it for key activity of a myth rather than exploratory as in most Bitsy works?)
  - walls (invisible and visible, preventing movements most obviously, most often for realism/"physics" of various kinds, including chains - also the concept of detail through multiple tiles creating a single object, the bathtub and the rock)
  - items versus sprites (dialog element is crucial here, as well as their interaction with the palette to look distinct, dialog [see also: Twine] a central way to communicate some more complex and unrepresentable concept?) (maybe collapse these two?)
  - items (total failure despite burning desire to use them!)
  - palettes (oddities around connotations of colours and shared palettes, black clouds and white apples etc.)
  - rooms and exits (for state rather than space in Danaids, "rolling" in Sisyphus, "time" in Zeno - I guess all room transitions are used to represent time rather than space?)
  - intro/title (as a way to include instructions and take some burden off the communication of the scene itself)
  - Extensions (and avoiding them)
- I think I like the idea of going this way, and it allows me to tell of various "battles" with the Bitsy Way. Very much feels like a story of a fight to "tell my story" with a vocabulary at some kind of oppositional angle to that story. Interesting coming so specifically from a more "videogame" telling of these things to something that already has all the game mechanics baked in, rather than first-order stuff you can build to your idea
- Comparison with Twine somewhere makes sense (probably in the intro?)

I actually think this isn't too bad an attempt. I think even if some of these sections are little there's something nice about the fact you can really break down Bitsy like this and talk about all its pieces quite successfully? And I think it's also true that in reviewing each one you can talk about how they're leveraged - almost every single one has one or more stories to tell. Plus images. Plus links to commits. I think this will work and should be comparatively easy to write? (Famous last words?)
