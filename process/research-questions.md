Another one of those cases where I simply haven't written these prior to actually making the project, which kind of makes most of this redundant in terms of "research", but just allows me to indicate, as per usual, what I think is interesting in terms of what's going on here.

## Translation

Clearly this is part of the ongoing interest in translating between forms, in this case from a standard "retro" style (or indeed from the punishment myths themselves) into the Bitsy engine specifically, including all its many limitations - thus allowing for an exploration of how those limitations (and affordances) can be used to express the specific ideas required for the myths.

## Repetition with variation

Similarly clearly, this is part of the very specific project of translating and reimagining a single game design concept (the punishments), being the tenth variation in the ancient greek punishment series. It's really starting to build up a pretty diverse set of approaches to the basic question of how one designs a game especially in conversation with the materials, including engines and genres (as well as, in other cases, how one varies some specific part of the design to dramatic effect). Bitsy is especially interesting, as above, because it's just so limited - a lot of fighting with the engine to get something resembling what I want.
