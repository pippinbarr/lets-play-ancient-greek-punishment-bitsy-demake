## Description
*The boulder is practically square! The apple is bare recognisable! Yet you push! Yet you reach! Yet you strain! Yet you weep! Punishment knows no minimum resolution!*

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Bitsy Demake_ is yet another new edition in the [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment](https://pippinbarr.com/ideas/ancient-greek-punishment/) series, each focusing on a retelling of five (kind of) mythological punishments. In _Bitsy Demake_ the game is retold in the form of a Bitsy game using Adam Ledoux's wonderful game-creation tool [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy).
